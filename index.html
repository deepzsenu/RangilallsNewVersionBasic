                  Automatic bidding places bids on your behalf at pre-specified
                  increments. Simply enter your maximum bid (the highest amount you
                  are willing to pay), and the increment amount.

                Any new bid must be greater than the current high bid. The minimum
                additional amount you're required to add on the previous bid is
                called the bid increment.

                After you place a bid on the auction item page, you cannot cancel
                the bid. So before you bid, be very careful whether you are willing
                to bid or you have the sufficient fund to fulfill your bidding
                commitment.

              <p>
                The reserve price is the lowest price the seller is willing to
                accept for the auction item. In fact, the seller puts a reserve
                price for every item he posts before the starting of an auction.

                that your bid is currently the highest bid. To win, the auction must
